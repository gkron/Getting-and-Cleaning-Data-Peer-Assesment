Getting & Cleaning Data Peer Assessment
=======================================

### Assessment Directions
You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
The first step in my procedure is to download the data. The process will check
to see if the zip file exists and if so it will give the user a warning message.
If not it will download the zip file.  
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

### Deliverables
1. Please upload a tidy data set according to the instructions in the project description. Please upload your data set as a separate file (do not cut and paste a dataset directly into the text box, as this may cause errors saving your submission).
2. Please submit a link to a Github repo with the code for performing your analysis. The code should have a file run_analysis.R in the main directory that can be run as long as the Samsung data is in your working directory. The output should be the tidy data set you submitted for part 1. You should include a README.md in the repo describing how the script works.
